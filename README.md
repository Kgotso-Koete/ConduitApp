# About the project

This is the code I wrote following the [Thinkster IO](https://thinkster.io/) tutorial on building a Medium clone (blogging social network) using the MERN stack (Mongodb Express React and Node) and is based on the ([Thinkster IO Real World App](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld), from the [Thinkster Full Stack tutorial series](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fullstack) by [Thinkster IO](https://thinkster.io/)

This code is for the back end. [here is the tutorial](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/node-json-api). The front end code I wrote can be found [here]().
